# Calculator
About the Project
Welcome to my simple calculator! This is a fun little project I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs the basic math operations we all use daily—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The design is clean, and it works smoothly whether you're on a desktop or mobile device.
